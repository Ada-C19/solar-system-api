# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*
Allie - 
Amber - Just the repo, and we have that sorted! And red bull. Lots of red bull.

## Collaboration vs. individual work expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations- does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*
Allie - 
Amber - I'm okay doing it either way. As we found out last project, some things can be done independently while others have to be online/paired as other parts may rely on previous code.

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*
Allie - 
Amber - Working through it with notes in front of me for easy reference.

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*
Allie - 
Amber - 

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*
Allie - 
Amber - I'm not the best at communication, so I'd love to work on keeping in good contact with where I'm at. So much easier when we're on the same page!

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
